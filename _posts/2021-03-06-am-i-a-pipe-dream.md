*My love, Catherine, 8533 and 167 days have passed.*

I just got out of the shower after crying for twenty minutes while listening to On the Nature of Daylight. The last two weeks have been horrific, in retrospect, and things are bubbling over now. I don't know where to go from here.

About two weeks ago, I tested my blood sugar levels on a whim and got shocked to see pre-diabetic levels, so I continued testing for the next few days at the expense of my mental stability. I became more and more panicked and concerned that somehow, over the past five months, I've managed to develop diabetes. Anyone that I've left behind in my life wouldn't be surprised to hear me say that because they all regarded me as a Coca-Cola addict, and rightfully so, but the past one and a half years have seen that change. I stopped intaking so much sugar, and I exercised regularly, until my blood sugar levels stabilized well below pre-diabetic range. So, of course I would be shocked when five months later without relapsing into my old habits, my levels were astronomically higher.

I didn't do anything wrong, did I? And so the hunt to figure how I fucked up started. I've pointed fingers at having to wake up at 2am and eat dinner before classes, being unable to exercise as much since I had to sleep at the times I used to exercise before, and reluctantly, being on testosterone blockers. I don't know how much any of this has contributed to it, and if I'm still missing something, but it's been enough for me to start forcing changes in hopes that I can do something about this, though if my medication really is doing something to my blood sugar level, am I prepared to stop taking it?

That's where the crying started, not because of the my blood sugar or the fact I felt I couldn't tell anyone about this because all they would have to say is, "I told you so," but because I started to question my transition. It's been five months, five months of next to nothing. Being on blockers alone isn't going to do much for me, the country hasn't had any progynova for god knows how long, and even though I'm getting some shipped in, those will only last two weeks and I'm not sure if I should even use them anymore, considering my blood sugar. I haven't done anything substantial, and I'm becoming more doubtful that I'll get the care I need when I leave. I even told myself last month I would start voice training while I was still here, and I am yet to do anything. Is this what I'm meant for? Am I doomed to have no progress with my medical transition? If so, does it even make sense to do anything else? Was all of this just a pipe dream? Am I a pipe dream? What then?

I thought about what it would feel like abandoning this and going back, but it was just emptiness. There is nothing for me there. So even if I'm not moving now and I'm scared I'll be stuck here the rest of my life, it's better than where I used to be. Regardless, the question still remains, what the fuck do I do now?

*Change takes time, Catherine.*
