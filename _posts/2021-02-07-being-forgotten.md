*My love, Catherine, 8533 and 140 days have passed.*

I'm on break again, and I've done nothing but play games this time. I didn't really have any plans for this break anyway, because I didn't even know I was having a break. Maybe this is much needed time off or maybe I'm making up excuses to be sorry for myself. I don't really care either way.

I got cold sweats today as I thought about this amazing ex-coworker I always looked up to (and I still do), and how she has moved on so far from where she used to be when we were working at the same place. I'm extremely happy for her, but I feel like the world is leaving me behind. It's the same feeling as when I see my peers progressing our field, all I can do is look on while the world forgets me. But if I am to even have a chance at safety in my future, I need to be forgotten, so hopefully less people will connect the dots and figure out that I'm trans. Maybe that's inevitable, but I need to try.

Close to eight years ago, I started figuring out that I was trans, and, simultaneously, I started trying to minimize myself - my voice, my personality, my impact, everything. Despite those efforts, I became known to some people, and for some things, because I was fighting a daily battle battle between wanting to be somebody and making something out of my life, and being a ghost so I can disappear and start over without anyone realizing. I guess all I have done through that internal conflict can be called a compromise. I got a bit of both.

It's been one and a half years now since I decided to finally put that life behind me and commit more to being forgotten. It has been such a relief of burden to no longer have to live two lives, but it hurts still. Do you know what it's like to spend twenty-two years building your life and making something out of it just to have to throw it all away at a chance at your future? It's not like it's even something I wanted to do. If there was a way to keep my old life while still ensuring safety and anonymity in my future, I would do it, but Guyanese society has forced my hand.

I still cannot put it well enough into words how much this hurts, to the point that I used to sometimes resent myself for being this way because I knew it meant having to throw everything away. It's likely that pain that stopped me writing this months ago when I saw pictures of my old classmates hanging out and felt the light leave my eyes. To look on from the shadows at everyone moving forward while I have to start all over again, feeling like I'm doing nothing, is beyond stifling at times.

It's not fair, but nothing ever is. I think of why society has to be this way to push me to do this, and maybe why I couldn't have been born in years from now when people like me wouldn't have to hide who they are and 'who they used to be' in order to not get harassed on a daily basis for simply existing.

Don't get me wrong, embracing myself and shifting my life has been one of the best decisions I've ever made. I just wished it didn't mean having to sacrifice so much. Sure, I need to be forgotten, but that doesn't stop it from hurting.

*Starting over is also progress, Catherine.*
