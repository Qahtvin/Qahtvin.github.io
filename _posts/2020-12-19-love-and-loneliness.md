*My love, Catherine, 8533 and 89 days have passed.*

I have a break from my classes right now, and I've been trying to relax. I haven't been able to get my mind off a few thing, however. At least writing is therapeutic.

I was lying in bed one stressful, somewhat cold night, and I refused to pick up my phone. I instinctively clutched the pillow I sometimes hug while I sleep - a habit I picked up since my last relationship as I just thought of my partner while I would sleep with it - and I felt the lack of warmth despite that space next to me being filled. I realized at that point, it's been a few years since I've had someone to hug or cuddle, and while I've been so busy with studying, work, and setting a foundation for my life, I do miss having someone there to pay me some attention from time to time. Maybe just to touch my cheek or sweep my hair out of my face. "I've become a bit lonely again," I thought, so I held my own hand and fell asleep. There wasn't much of a point in getting worked up about it, at least not then.

I remember I was one day away from resigning myself from love and relationships when I met my last partner, and I spent some of my best days in the year that followed. I truly appreciate our relationships, even though it came to an end, and I learned many things about myself in love though that relationship. But, since then, I haven't felt any strong feelings for anyone besides this one wonderful individual who became a precious friend of mine, and I haven't felt the need or desire to be in a relationship again. After all, I'm not the kind of person to search for partners or relationships, I rather they find me when I least expect it. It's obviously not the best idea since I seek companionship, but I do not find any joy in searching. So, it may be some time until love finds me again, but I worry that I may find myself falling back into the same path towards resignation, but for a different reason this time.

This pool of possible companions for me has grown ever small. I've only ever been interested in other women, and finding women who took an interest in me was a challenge by itself, but now having to find gay women willing to date a trans woman is much more of an arduous task. I think, for many reason, I find parts of that premise uncomfortable, but that's a different conversation for a different time. The fact of the matter is that the idea that I will be able to find someone to love me at some point in my life seems like an impossible task, especially if I'm not actively searching for them, because the dating pool for transgender people seems so much smaller than any other generic pool. Regardless of the reasons why that is, I can't help but think there is no point in fighting to find this love, and I should resign myself to avoid wasting my time struggling over it.

I obviously still want to be loved by a companion, but I wonder whether that will ever be in my future. Maybe I may even end up finding this in a man. I have notice my sexuality and romantic attraction becoming more fluid since I started hormone replacement therapy, so who knows. That does not necessarily make things easier for me, because being a transgender women, I will have to sift through the numerous men that only see me as an animated sex toy for their fetish. At the end of the day, love and relationships are much more difficult for me to find because of my identity, and I can't help but to continue feeling helpless and lonely.

*It is okay to feel lonely sometimes, Catherine.*
