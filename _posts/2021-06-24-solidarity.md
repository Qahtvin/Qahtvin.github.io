*My love, Catherine, 8533 and 272 days have passed.* 

Life is slowly moving along, as I am seeing progress with myself creeping forward. That in itself is a satisfying and validating experience, but I must ensure I stop along the way to check in with my friends and reconnect with old ones so I don't lose anyone simply to the passage of time.

I recently caught up with an old coworker. We've really gotten on with life since we last spoke or saw each other, so it was quite refreshing spending time with them. While we spoke, there was one mention of a mutual issue we found ourselves involved in and we spoke of how the fallout from that issue has manifested in our friends. It has made me think again about how my friends have reacted and proceeded since then, and how I am still upset about it. In thinking, I decided to write this because this issue is more than that incident. This is about solidarity. If I can't expect people to show solidarity on such a small scale, what will happen when it comes to my identity? In fact, much has happened to give me a vague idea of what to expect.

The past few years have seen a monstrous increase in amount of hatred and push-back that the transgender community regularly receives. Household names, large corporations, and politicians have come out in their numbers to create this idea of 'the transgender debate,' as though our lives and existences in this world should be ultimately decided by other people. In many cases, this has manifested as more than just conversation, like the tsunami of bills in the US, or the further gatekeeping of trans healthcare in the UK. Moreover, the overwhelming support of these leaders has emboldened more common folks to act on their biases more often to be violent or vocal against us.

Of course, we push back for the little rights and peace we are afforded, with the support of our sibling communities and some allies, but most people are silent. I cannot expect many of them to even know what is going on, but I wish that they cared. This is, however, not uncommon, since the impartial majority have often left minorities and marginalized groups to suffer while they pride themselves in their non-oppressive actions and attitudes, as if the inaction helps our cause.

It is this inaction I see mirrored in my own friends, despite their allied stance. Of course I do not expect my friends to be my freedom fighters, but I would have expected some concern and respect. Much too often I have seen some leaders, figures, and corporations take a transphobic stance only to have my friends react, forget, and continue on with their lives as though nothing happened. Surely not all of these things directly affect me, but any move against any trans person is a move against me, and if you are quiet when these people try to illegalize us, then you are complicit in my oppression. And even though my nihilism tells me I cannot expect otherwise, I am angry and disappointed.

Solidarity is more than saying it or talking to me about what people have done; you need to make active changes in your life. Is that a tall order? Yes, and I expect any friend of mine would care enough to push back against this world that is trying to erase my existence with laws, gatekeeping, and violence.

*Cherish those who show solidarity, Catherine.*
