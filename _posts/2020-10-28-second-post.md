**My love, Catherine, 8533 and 37 days have passed.** 

Welcome to the internet. I initially wrote in a new book with a pretty cover to start documenting my life and the struggles I deal with as a transgender woman, but I decided this would be a good chance to start a blog so my friends and others can see the raw feelings and emotions I go through by detailing them. Here, I will write letters of sorts, but they may be slightly modified from those I write in my physical book, if I feel the need to do so. The letters may be long or short, and sometimes make no sense, but that is to be expected from me.
