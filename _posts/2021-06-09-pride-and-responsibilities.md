*My love, Catherine, 8533 and 255 days have passed.*

Time still seems difficult to find for writing, especially since I found a wonderful daily schedule. I will find time now and then, like right now, but maybe I should dedicate time to this more often.

It's pride month now! This year makes the second pride I've celebrated, and I'm closing in on 300 days since I started hormones. So, there is a lot to do! But, it also leaves me wondering what I should do at all. I want to continue taking time to go out on my milestones, despite being alone every time because most people ignore it, while the ones who don't also tend to be busy or not around. Well, I am opening up to a new friend soon, and the last one went well, so I have that to look forward to this month. SASOD also has events, so I'm sure I can find things to do.

Besides those celebratory activities, I want to take this month to reflect on my identity and express that to others. While I have no plans to come out publicly, and probably never will because I shouldn't have to, the temptation always increases around this time. Hiding is burdensome in its own way, so opening to a few close people is fine; those people that I want to keep in my life. But, that does not feel like enough this time around, I want to do more.

Ever since I started accepting myself, I realized the responsibilities I have as a trans woman in Guyana. No one told me I had to do these things, because surely someone eventually will, but I am in a position to do them, so I should. Guyanese society does not yet understand transgender people and what it means to be transgender. So, in their ignorance, they learn to hate and despise us. Unfortunately, because of this, most trans people are not afforded the education or employment to be taken seriously by others. They are often forced into sex work, which makes their opinions even less valued by Guyanese society. That's where I come in. I was afforded a tertiary education and a job, so it would be easier for me to appeal to people, make a case for the community, and educate Guyanese society. I won't be able to speak for all trans people, but I can at least try to be a beacon.

I never intended to follow this path though, and I'm not sure how far I'll take it anyway. Guyana does not want trans people, so I always wanted to stay hidden here. I'd pretend to be cis in the best case scenario, but it feels unjust to do nothing when I can do something. I'll continue to mull it over during pride month and see where I end up.

*Noble causes come with both gain and sacrifice, Catherine.*
