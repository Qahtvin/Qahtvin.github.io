*My love, Catherine, 8533 and 37 days have passed.*

Welcome to the internet. I initially wrote in a new book with a pretty cover to start documenting my life and the struggles I deal with as a transgender woman, but I decided this would be a good chance to start a blog so my friends and others can see the raw feelings and emotions I go through by detailing them. Here, I will write letters of sorts, but they may be slightly modified from those I write in my physical book, if I feel the need to do so. The letters may be long or short, and sometimes make no sense, but that is to be expected from me.

As I was falling asleep yesterday. I recalled my love life. It has often been complicated, but the most striking of all was in my last relationship. Prior to this relationship, I had avoided dating and getting into relationships because of my identity as a transgender woman, although I had been unsure of my identity up until the last year or so. Furthermore, I got into this relationship on the premise that my partner was such that my identity would be a non-factor.

I was comfortable in the relationship; yet , when I come to mentioning my identity, I bawled for close to two hours while I could barely say the words I wanted to without choking up. Why?

The few explanations I came up with revolve around the damaging ideas society has injected into me, throughout my life, about my identity. But, aside from those, I think there was this idea that I was lying about who I was for the first few months of the relationship. I was, because I was being the individual I was presenting as in public, rather than who I was.

Taking that into account, society had convinced me that I should be ashamed of myself. I was a disgrace to men everywhere, because of course they only saw me as a 'man in a dress.' This tells more on the idea of valuation society has based on gender; men are the most respected and valued followed by women, and even less so, transgender women. We are the bottom of the barrel, and we should feel bad about it. Obviously we shouldn't, but that's what society tells us.

I don't think this would have been so difficult for me if it had not been for the relationship and love. I was so scared that I would no longer be loved because I was a transgender woman and not a cisgender man. At the time, I was still loved, but months later when my partner decided they wanted to break up with me, it was because I was a woman and they realized they could not find themselves to love a woman. It was justifiable and fair, but the way they put it over stung for months on end. They broke up with me because I was transgender, and although they clarified what they meant, I didn't hear any of it. In that moment, all of my fears about the impact of my identity on my love life came to the surface; I remember barely reacting, coming off as if I didn't care, but how could I? I spent the entire relationship steeling myself for this moment because no matter how comfortable I was in the relationship, they would eventually change their mind. So, it became a mixture of expectations being met, and feeling numb at the sore realization that, yes, I really was undeserving of love because of my identity, and that that messed up my chances of ever being happy in love. I was so torn about losing this true love that I began to resent this side of me for the following months. If I wasn't like this, maybe they'd still love me. I no longer felt like a woman; when I looked in the mirror, I would see a 'man in a dress.' I became disgusted with my identity and distanced myself from it, although not by choice. No one could ever love a transgender woman, I was convinced.

Fortunately, as with most things, I dissociated and examined the situation. Of course, what I saw was that these new feelings were only from the trauma I suffered. I knew I needed to process my feelings and eventually overcome the trauma, but how the fuck do I do that? Where do I even start? Honestly, I'm not entirely sure how I managed, but I put things to rest as well as I could with my partner, now back to friend, and there were several times I remembering things that validated my identity and allowed me to be sure of myself again.

Even now, it's not perfect, but I feel much more sure and better about myself. I don't believe I am undeserving of love, although it may still be a long time until I go searching for it, or dating.

*Remember to love yourself, Catherine.*
