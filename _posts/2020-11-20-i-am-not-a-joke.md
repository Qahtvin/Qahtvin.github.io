*My love, Catherine, 8533 and 61 days have passed.*

I have been quite busy with school, so I haven't had the time to write, despite having so many things to write about. Maybe then, having a power outage today, as I was studying, was a stroke of luck. I have some time to write now.

I recall seeing a post some time ago about Guyanese comedians needing to expand their pool of humour and jokes in a way that shifts their focus away from jokes about gay men, and it reminded me of their treatment of transgender women. The earliest Guyanese comedies I can recall all pulled punches against transgender women in at least some portion of the skit, even if it wasn't intentionally transphobic. In its most innocent form, it was simply a male comedian dressed in female clothing, playing a character, and there is nothing inherently wrong with that, especially when we think of cases like Madea or Mrs. Doubtfire. Those two are quite funny and rightfully so, but there is a line that Guyanese comedians cross, and quite often at that. For them, it is not about creating comedy based on a character. For them, it devolves into a sort of fourth wall breaking where the main joke is: "Look at me, I'm a man in a dress, not actually a woman, and that's funny." Again, this does not necessarily mean they are being transphobic if you take it at face value; some men dress in female clothing because it's funny how they may fit on a masculine body, but the problem comes when these characters and displayers are made intentionally to pander to the transphobic views and ideals of their audiences. These manifest as high-pitched voices, over exaggerated attempts at female proportions, and intentionally overly feminine demeanors, among other things, all as signals of what the character represents: a mockery of transgender women.

Guyanese people find great humour in the existence of transgender women, and this allows and encourages these comedians to keep doing this. They see us as a joke, something to laugh at, because of the awkward nature we have as we go through transition. This comes more from other opinions and ideas Guyanese have about transgender women, and is a part of why I say Guyana does not want transgender people, but that is a whole other issue to go through.

Turning our existence into a farce is much more damaging than many realize. I can't help but draw a parallel to black-face. In a similar way, we are treated as subhuman and the only acceptable portrayal of our existence is as a farce. To them, we aren't deserving of respect as a person, because we are a thing.

The worst part of all of this is how normal this is for most Guyanese. I was fed these comedies growing up and was taught that they were funny, to laugh at myself before I even had the words to understand who I was. So, from a young age, I was taught that there was no respect or value to be had for me in this world, that I was nothing more than a punchline. It's one of the things I internalized while growing up, and have been working hard to erase from the internalized transphobia that still shackles me.

*You are not a joke, Catherine.*
