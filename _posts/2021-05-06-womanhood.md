*My love, Catherine, 8533 and 228 days have passed.*

Last weekend, I was having an especially shitty night. I wrote a poem then, the first one I wrote since the image, in my mind, of the shadow of my muse faded. The next day I wrote a poem for you. I call it:

***Womanhood***

I grew up pretending to be someone else\
But I learned to embrace myself\
Me, a woman\
And others welcomed me

Catcalled when I'm minding my business\
Welcome to womanhood!\
Followed home by strange men\
Welcome to womanhood!\
Being forced into society's image of women\
Welcome to womanhood!

You wouldn't welcome your cisters into this filth\
Why do you think I wish to be?\
Do not welcome me into the worst parts of womanhood\
As thought I have to now know how it feels\
Like I have to pay for not living this all along

*Their resentment is misplaced, Catherine.*
